This is really simple web framework which is written in node. There is plenty of crap left to handle but this is a pretty good start.

# Using it
1. Check out the repo.
2. Run `node keys.js`.
3. Navigate to `localhost:9876`.
4. Check out `key.js` to see where you can navigate and for simple examples.
